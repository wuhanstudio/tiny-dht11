This license agreement is as correct as I believe it can be. I have kept the advert for CoPiino
as it states the text must be included when redistributed.

      CoPiino Electronics invests time and resources providing this open source code,
      please support CoPiino Electronics and open-source hardware by purchasing
      products from CoPiino Electronics!

      What is it?
        This library is derived from GOFi2cOLED library, only for SSD1306 in I2C Mode.
        As the original library only supports Frame Buffered mode which requires to have
        at least 1024bytes of free RAM for a 128x64px display it is too big for smaller devices.

        So this a SSD1306 library that works great with ATTiny85 devices :)
